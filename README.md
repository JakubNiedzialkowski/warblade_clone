# Spaceblade: Galaxy Chronicles

This application is a 2D mobile game developed in Unity. It's heavily inspired by the game Warblade. It was built to learn game development in Unity. It features use of VFX and SFX and touch controls. Additionally it collects simple performance such as beaten enemy waves, items bought in store, amount of collected money and default session data using Unity Analytics.

## Gameplay

The goal is to destroy oncoming enemy waves with your ship. Enemies will appear in waves at the top and the side of the screen whereas player controlled ship is located at the bottom of the screen and can move left and right. Enemies randomly shoot projectiles towards the bottom of the screen and player can shoot up towards the enemies. Enemy kills have a randomized chance to drop weapon upgrades or money that can be used to buy items in shop every 5 stages. Additionally every 5 enemy waves there is a boss encounter. Bosses are tougher enemies with special attacks and will drop large amounts of money upon being destroyed. At maximum player can have 3 lives and 2 shields. Getting hit with enemy projectile will destroy 1 player shield(if available) or 1 health. Losing health resets the ship to the bottom middle of the screen and downgrades weapon level by 1 to the minimum of single shot(basic attack).
